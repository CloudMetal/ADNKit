ADNKit is a brand new Objective-C framework for building App.net iOS and OS X applications. The guiding design principles are:
* Simple and easy to understand API, designed for making things happen quickly
* As much heavylifting as possible is done for you
* 100% App.net API support
* No external dependencies other than AFNetworking

It's also important to note that many parts of core architecture in this framework is based on [Matt Rubin](https://github.com/mattrubin)'s fantastic architectural work in his [AppDotNet](https://github.com/mattrubin/AppDotNet) project. My hat's off to him for designing a truly excellent framework architecture and open sourcing it!

# Current State
ADNKit is very much a work in progress right now, and 100% of the ADN API has not yet been reached. Here is a quick overview of what Resource API groups are supported.

| Resource  | Support|
| --------- | ------:|
| User      | ![check](https://github.com/joeldev/ADNKit/raw/master/Images/greencheck.png) Full |

# Getting Started
Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/joeldev/ADNKit/wiki) for full documentation.

### Installation
ADNKit makes use of submodules for its dependencies. After cloning the repo, make sure to run `git submodule update --init --recursive` from the top level before trying to build the code. There is also a Releases folder containing stable binary releases.

**It's also important to note that AFNetworking is compiled in as part of the library and does not need to be added to your project.**

### Hello, world!

##### Authentication

[More information about authentication with ADNKit](https://github.com/joeldev/ADNKit/wiki/Authentication), including how to set up and implement both Username/Password and OAuth authentication.

```objc
/* this assumes you have two text fields, usernameField and passwordField */

// ask for permission to see user information and send new Posts
ADNAuthScope requestedScopes = ADNAuthScopeBasic | ADNAuthScopeWritePost;

// handler to call when finished authenticating
id handler = ^(BOOL success, NSError *error) {
	if (success) {
		NSLog(@"we are authenticated and ready to make API calls!");
	} else {
		NSLog(@"could not authenticate, error: %@", error);
	}
};

// authenticate, calling the handler block when complete
[[ADNClient sharedClient] authenticateUsername:usernameField.text
									  password:passwordField.text
									  clientID:@"xxxxxx"
						   passwordGrantSecret:@"zzzzzz"
						         	authScopes:requestedScopes
						     completionHandler:handler];
```

Once the completion block is called with a successful response, you are completely good to go and can start using the rest of the API calls immediately.

##### Creating Posts

Now that we are authenticated with App.net, let's make our inaugural Post:

```objc
[[ADNClient sharedClient] createPostWithText:@"Hello, world!" completion:^(ADNPost *post, NSError *error) {
    NSLog(@"post created! %@", post ?: error);
}];
```

It's just that easy! You should see a new post from yourself in your stream, and a Post object in your console!

You could have also achieved the same thing with:
```objc
ADNPost *post = [[ADNPost alloc] init];
post.text = @"Hello, world!";
[[ADNClient sharedClient] createPost:post completion:^(ADNPost *post, NSError *error) {
    NSLog(@"post created! %@", post ?: error);
}];
```
Using the model objects directly lets you set them up completely (such as setting post.annotations). There is not a convenience method for everything, so more advanced situations are intended to be handled by creating the model object, setting it up how you want it, and then sending it to the server.
